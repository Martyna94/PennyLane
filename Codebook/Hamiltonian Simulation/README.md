* H 1
  * Describe the distinction between the behaviour of deterministic, random, and quantum systems.
* H 2
  * Describe how unitarity arises from preservation of marginal probabilities.
* H 3
  * Define a Hamiltonian and explain what it means with respect to a quantum system.
  * Compute unitary evolution for a simple, single-qubit physical system.
