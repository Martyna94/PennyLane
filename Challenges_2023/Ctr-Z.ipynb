    "Zenda and Reece work at Trine's Designs, a startup run by the eccentric inventor Doc Trine. Trine promises to tell Zenda and Reece about a revolutionary new type of quantum resource she has invented called \"timbits\". Before explaining timbits, she insists on demonstrating [Bennett's Laws of Infodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennett%27s_laws), governing the behaviour of quantum information. \"Only then,\" she says, \"will the power of timbits be revealed in their full glory.\""
