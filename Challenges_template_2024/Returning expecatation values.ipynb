    "Review of quantum circuits in PennyLane\n",
    "-------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip to Challenge statement if you are already familiar with simple quantum circuits in PennyLane.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to PennyLane, this is the perfect coding challenge for you! In this challenge, you will build a simple PennyLane circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central to PennyLane is the `QNode`, or Quantum Node. This object combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A device\n",
    "* A quantum function\n",
    "* Any additional configuration information\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need a `device`. The device evaluates a quantum function. It could be either a simulator or actual quantum hardware. For the purpose of this coding challenge, we use \"default.qubit\", a simple built-in simulator that does not require external dependencies. To initialize a \"default.qubit\" device, we also need to specify the number of wires.\n",
    "`num_wires = 2\n",
    "dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=num_wires)`\n",
    "Usually, a wire is just a qubit. Any hashable object can label a wire, but people often denote individual wires by numbers (0, 1, 2) or strings (\"alice\", \"auxiliary\").\n",
    "Quantum functions accept classical inputs, apply quantum operations, and return one or more quantum measurement statistics. We write quantum functions as plain, old Python functions, but with some constraints; the function always needs to return a measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can put these components together to see the required structure of a quantum function:\n",
    "`def my_quantum_function(param):\n",
    "    qml.PauliZ(wires=0) # a single-wire gate\n",
    "    qml.RX(param, wires=0) # a single-wire parameterized gate\n",
    "    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1]) # a two-wire gate\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Finally we return a measurement of an operator on a wire\n",
    "    return qml.expval(qml.PauliX(0))\n",
    "`\n",
    "While quantum functions look like Python functions, you can't call my_quantum_function on its own and have the described circuit executed. We instead have to call a QNode, an object containing both a quantum function and a device.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly create a qnode, we apply a decorator that modifies the quantum function. The decorator takes the function as input and spits out something new that we can evaluate.\n",
    "`@qml.qnode(dev)\n",
    "def my_quantum_function(param):\n",
    "    qml.PauliZ(wires=0) # a single-wire gate\n",
    "    qml.RX(param, wires=0) # a single-wire parameterized gate\n",
    "    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1]) # a two-wire gate\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Finally we return a measurement of an operator on a wire\n",
    "    return qml.expval(qml.PauliX(0))\n",
    "\n",
    "result = my_quantum_function(0.1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge statement\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "You are tasked with calculating the expectation value for a measurement of a rotated qubit. To achieve this, you will need to\n",
    "* define a device\n",
    "* create a quantum function and QNode\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum function in the second should:\n",
    "* Rotate the qubit around  the y-axis by an angle $/phi$ using `qml.RY`\n",
    "* Return the expectation value `qml.expval` of `qml.PauliX`\n",
    "\n",
    "![circuit](./images/ReturningExpectationValue_1.png)\n",
    "For those that prefer to see the mathematics, we can write the problem as:\n",
    "$$\\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle = R_y(\\phi)\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle = e^{-i\\phi\\sigma_y/2}\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\n",
    "\\text{ans} = \\left\\langle \\phi \\middle| X \\middle| \\phi \\right\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge code\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code shown, you must complete the simple_circuit function, which takes the argument angle (float)—corresponding to ϕ in the challenge statement above— and returns a float corresponding the expectation value of the Pauli X operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you must complete some lines to define a PennyLane device and add a decorator to define a QNode.\n",
    "Here are some helpful resources and hints:\n",
    "* [Introduction](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/pennylane.html)\n",
    "* [Circuit](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/circuits.html)\n",
    "* [Quantum Operations](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/operations.html)\n",
    "* [Measurements](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/measurements.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Input\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple_circuit function is a QNode that receives one float angle, corresponding to the rotation angle ϕ in the $R_y$ gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output is a float corresponding to the expectation value of the Pauli X operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Although the qml.expval measurement returns an np.tensor containing one float, you don't need to worry about extracting it. We will do this for you."
