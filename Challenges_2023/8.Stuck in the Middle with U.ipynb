    "## Tutorial #8 - Mid-circuit measurements\n",
    "In classical computations, inserting control flow — e.g, if statements — right in the middle of a large computation is no problem at all since measuring variables does not affect the output of the computation. The same can't be said about quantum computations — if we measure, we better be careful!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you'll look at how mid-circuit measurements work in PennyLane.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge code**\n",
    "In the code below, you are given a function called circuit. You must complete this function by constructing the following four-qubit circuit:\n",
    "![circuit](./images/8.Stuck%20in%20the%20Middle%20with%20U_1.png)\n",
    "The circuit has a Hadamard gate on every qubit, an $R_x$ gate, a couple of CNOTs, and then the mid-circuit measurements. Note here that the measurements happen on the first and third qubits, and that the [qml.U3](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.U3.html) gate is only applied to the fourth qubit if the following condition is met upon measuring the first and third wires: $m_0 + m_2 >=1$ (i.e. at least one of them is $1$). The last operator, `qml.PauliZ` on the fourth qubit, is applied regardless.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [qml.measure](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.measure.html) function should be helpful to you!"
