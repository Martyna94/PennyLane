    "**Backstory**\n",
    "Zenda and Reece work at a firm, Trine's Designs, that uses quantum devices for very silly things. Their job as physicists is fun, since they get to program and fix quantum devices of all sorts, such as clocks, coffee machines, and lazy-worker detectors. The office has purchased a new quantum clock. To tell time, one has to read quantum states. They'd better get used to it, or they'll be late for their meetings!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The clock and the Bloch circumference**\n",
    "The Bloch sphere is the most widespread representation of a qubit. However, if we only consider states whose amplitudes are real, you could represent what we will call the Bloch circumference.\n",
    "![bloch](./images/Tick-Tock%20Bloch_1.png)\n",
    "In the figure above, we are representing the state $\\Ket{+}$ on our circle, since the arrow points in this direction. This circumference is completely equivalent to the blue one, shown below inside the Bloch sphere.\n",
    "![bloch](./images/Tick-Tock%20Bloch_2.png)\n",
    "In Zenda and Reece's office, the new way to tell the time is to read two states in Bloch's circumference. The state  corresponds to 12h on a clock,$\\Ket{1}$  would be equivalent to 6h, $\\Ket{+}$ would be 9h, and so on. In this challenge we are going to work with 2 qubits. The first one corresponds to the hour hand and the second one to the minutes. You will be given the time of the day as the input and you will have to generate the quantum states equivalent to such time.\n",
    "![bloch](./images/Tick-Tock%20Bloch_3.png)\n",
    "Here's an example of a clock striking 1:30. The qubit on the first wire of your circuit will be the small hand, and the qubit on the second wire, the big hand."
