    "Trine is getting bored. \"So, we've finished the usual [Laws of Infodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennett%27s_laws). Let's make things more interesting!\" She shows Zenda and Reece to the office photocopier. \"I figured out a way to turn this into a quantum resource! Pretty cool huh?\" Zenda and Reece look at each other, puzzled as ever by Trine's unconventional ideas about office equipment. Trine pats the photocopier. \"Yup, this old thang can photocopy a basis state. You can use it to make Bell pairs! In fact, we can introduce the photocopier into our superdense and teleportation protocols in such a way that it turns infodynamic inequalities into equalities. We'll find that a photocopier is halfway between a qubit and an entangled bit! I always said this was a halfway-decent photocopier.\" Zenda and Reece shrug and start feeding qubits into the machine."

    "Zenda and Reece are having a bit too much fun feeding qubits into the photocopy machine. It's not very good at photocopying qubits, but it can copy basis states into new registers in the following way\n",
    "$$\\Ket{j} \\rightarrow \\Ket{j}\\Ket{j},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and extending linearly to the whole space. From linearity, you can prove yourself that the operator the photocopy machine is applying does not allow for copying arbitrary states!\n",
    "\n",
    "Zenda ponders the meaning of Trine's words. She wonders if she can use the photocopy machine as a quantum fax machine instead. That should be equivalent to quantum teleportation... except that I wouldn't need to do mid-circuit measurements. She convinces Reece to join on the mischief, sharing with him half of the Bell state\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's see how Zenda and Reece get away with this. Zenda has a state $\\Ket{\\psi}$ that she wants to transfer to Reece, and half of the Bell pair above. After doing some operations $Z$ on her two qubits, she can perform the copier operation that copies basis states into two registers inside the copy machine's server. That information is then transfered to Reece's printer where, after performing the print operation with his states, he prints the state $\\Ket{\\psi}$ into his half of the entangled pair.\n",

    "The basic idea is to replace the act of sending two classical bits, $j$ and $k$, with the act of copying two basis states:\n",
    "$$\\Ket{j,k}_Z \\rightarrow \\Ket{j,k}_Z\\Ket{j,k}_R,$$\n",
    "We can rewrite the Third Law of Infodynamics (superdense coding) in terms of cobits as\n",
    "$$1 qubit +1 ebit \\geqslant 2 cobits$$\n",
    "where $x \\geqslant y$ means having resource $x$ also provide resource $y$, and \"ebit\" means \"entangled bit\", i.e. half a Bell pair. Similarly, it is possible to perform teleportation coherently, so that sending random bits $j,k$ to correct the teleported state is instead a unitary involving $\\Ket{j,k}$ .This leads to a new version of the Fourth Law of Infodynamics (teleportation):\n",
    "$$1 ebit +2 cbits \\geqslant 1 qubit + 2 ebits$$\n",
