    "Note from the author: Can you believe it? A Canadian company that has held a hackathon every year for 5 years hasn't made a hockey-related challenge... until now! Don't worry though, you don't need to know the rules of hockey to do this challenge. But, we encourage you to learn the rules, watch a couple NHL or PWHL games, and see if you like it... just because.\n",

    "Challenge statement\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "You are powering through the snowy Tundra and stumble upon an ancient cave. Entering it, you see old drawings that look like \"🏒\" and \"🥅\". The ancient cave people of the Tundra played a game called \"ice hockey.\" This ancient tradition of sportsmanship has been passed on through generations and is still played today by the present Tundra population. In fact, a game of ice hockey is being played in the cave right now! Let's see if we can inject some quantum into it...\n",
    "\n",
    "Hockey is a game of speed, skill, and, most importantly for this challenge, elusiveness. When a player has the puck, will they pass? Shoot? Deke? A combination of any of those three? Whatever they decide to do, the goaltender (AKA goalie) is the last line of defence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inarguably, one of the worst-case scenarios for a goalie is when their team has let them down and a 2-on-0 happens: two players from the opposing team just have the goalie in their way — the goalie is on an island! Throughout a game of hockey, a goalie usually saves 90% of the shots they face. Of course, the save percentage drops for a 2-on-0.\n",
    "In this challenge, you're going to model a \"quantum\" 2-on-0. The opposing players are described by a quantum state\n",
    "∣ψ⟩=α∣01⟩+β∣10⟩+κ(∣00⟩+∣11⟩), where:\n",
    "* 10 represents player 1 shooting the puck,\n",
    "* 01 represents player 2 shooting the puck,\n",
    "* and 00 or 11 means the goalie has no idea who will shoot 🤷‍♂️\n",
    "\n",
    "The goalie is represented by a quantum state\n",
    "∣ϕ⟩=γ∣0⟩+δ∣1⟩, where\n",
    "0 represents the players scoring and 1 represents the goalie making a save. We will assume that δ>γ in this problem: the goalie has a higher chance of saving a puck than letting in a goal.\n",
    "The goalie is allowed to \"measure\" player 1 and player 2 to see if they can figure out where the puck is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if the goalie measures $\\(10\\)$, they know that player 1 is shooting and their chances of letting in a goal decrease: \\(|\\gamma'|^2 = x|\\gamma|^2\\), where \\(x < 1\\)\n",
    "* if the goalie measures \\(01\\), they know that player 2 is shooting and their chances of letting in a goal decrease: \\(|\\gamma'|^2 = y|\\gamma|^2\\), where \\(y < 1\\)\n",
    "* if the goalie measures \\(00\\) or \\(11\\), they don’t know who is going to shoot the puck and their chances of letting in a goal increase by a factor of \\(z\\): \\(|\\delta'|^2 = z|\\delta|^2\\), where \\(z \\leq 1\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to figure out the goalie's new save percentage after measuring player 1 and player 2.\n"

    "Challenge code\n",
    "In the code below you must complete the following functions and classes:\n",

    "* state_prep: this is a quantum function that contains operations to prepare the initial states ∣ψ⟩ and ∣ϕ⟩ given α, β, κ, γ, and δ. The players' wire labels are \"player1\" and \"player2\" and the goalie's wire label is \"goalie\", as shown in the device definition in the code below.\n",
    "* save_percentage: this is a QNode that implements the simulation mentioned in the challenge description above and calculates the new save percentage of the goalie — qml.probs(wires=[\"goalie\"]) — given α, β, κ, γ, δ,x, y, and z. In this QNode, you may only use 7 operations or less and you must use 3 mid-circuit measurement conditions (i.e., three instances of qml.cond).\n",
