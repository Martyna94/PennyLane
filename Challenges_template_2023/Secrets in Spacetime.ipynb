    "Now Zenda and Reece have a cute way to send each other private messages using entangled qubits. Trine applauds them. \"Good work! But now that I think of it, superdense coding can be reversed, in a manner of speaking, to send quantum information using entanglement and classical bits. This will not only bring us to the last [Law of Infodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennett%27s_laws), but teach us some basic facts about spacetime! Certain things have to be hidden from Nature itself.\" Zenda and Reece look perplexed. Trine smiles: \"Wait until I show you what timbits can do!\""
