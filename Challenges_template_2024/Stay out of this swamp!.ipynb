    "As you explore deep into the Femto Forest, you notice that the ground is a bit moist and thick. You see a sign with large bold letters telling you to \"Keep out of this swamp\". Resisting the urge to watch Shrek for the 100th time on your smartphone, you recall that you read about this place in a tourist guide. The Quantum Swamp of Peril is known to absorb any substance and turn it into a toxic version of itself. Leat you become a venomous zombie (and not the superhero kind), make sure to do as the sign says!\n",
    "While the transformation that the swamp applies on individual quantum states is still unknown, a simplified model suggests that might be a Quantum Singular Value Transform. This seems to be an approximation, and some scholars think that such monstrosities can only be created by non-linear quantum effects, hence the interest in studying this swamp!\n",

    "The Quantum Singular Value Transform (QSVT) is a quantum algorithm that has become really popular in the research community due to its many applications. In this challenge, we will study a precursor to QSVT, an algorithm known as Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). This algorithm works on one qubit and is given by the following circuit\n",
