    "Another way to express this circuit is in matrix form,$U(t) = e^{i\\alpha tZ_0}e^{i\\alpha tZ_1}$ . Schr√∂dinger's equation tells us, on the other hand, that $U(t) = e^{-i\\hat{H}/\\hbar} = e^{i \\alpha t(Z_0 Z_1)}$. These two expressions appear to be equal by virtue of the rule $e^{x+y} = e^xe^y$. But not so fast! We are dealing with matrices rather than numbers, and this makes a huge change.\n",
    "It turns out that, for matrices $A$ and $B$,$e^{A+B} = e^Ae^B$ is only tru when $A$ and $B$ can be freely reordered (commute), or $AB = BA$. We say such metrices **commute**. When term do not commute, exponentiating their sum is hard. As a concrete example, consider two nearby electrons, who can feel each other's magnetic field. The Hamiltonian will now include an interaction term since the spins of these electrons would like to anti-align:\n",
