Create a function called noisy_channel that flips  each bit b with an equal and independent probability p. For example, if the repeated bit string is 000, then the flipped bit string could be, say,100 , where only the first bit was flipped and the other two are safe.

    "Nice work! So, Alice encodes the bit $bbb$ as  and sends it through the noisy channel. Bob is on the other end and gets a three-bit string that may or may not resemble Alice's message. The instruction that Alice gives Bob to decode her message is to take the majority value of the three bits as the original message. For example, if Bob receives $010$, he deduces that Alice was trying to send him $b=0$ since that's the majority bit value. This begs the question: what are the chances that Bob actually gets it right?"
