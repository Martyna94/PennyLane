    "At Trine's Designs, the coffee machine is a programmable quantum device. It has three dials that tell the machine the type of drink it will prepare. However, two of the dials are broken. Trine, the CEO, is in despair: \"Coffee is essential for employees to function optimally.\" So, as a provisional solution while they contact the manufacturer, Trine calls Zenda and Reece to quickly reprogram the device so that it works with only one dial.\n",

    "**Expressivity in Quantum Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within QML it is common to find the term expressivity, which refers to the size of all possible models that we can generate by varying our parameters. One way to increase the expressivity of our model family is usually by adding more parameters. However, this is not always a good thing, since increasing the number of parameters, and therefore the number of possible models, means that we have to perform our training on a very large set, making it more difficult to find the model that best suits our needs. Therefore, the real challenge of a good QML researcher is to find the smallest possible family of models that still contains the optimal solution. There is much more to the notion of expressivity, but in this challenge we are going to push the concept to its limits.\n",

    "We don't know exactly what the basis state is, so we would like to generate an ansatz expressive enough so that:\n",
    "$$U(\\overrightarrow{\\theta_0})\\Ket{000} = \\Ket{000}$$\n",

    "This is the fundamental concept in [Basis embedding](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2022/08/how-to-embed-data-into-a-quantum-state/), where you can see that by taking $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ properly, we can generate any basis state. However, this challenge is not going to be this easy. You are asked to build an ansatz that, with only one parameter, is able to generate all the basis states. To judge your solution, we will ask you to provide us with a list of the 8 values of the parameter that generate each of them. Good luck!"
