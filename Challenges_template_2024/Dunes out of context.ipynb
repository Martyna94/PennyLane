    "Dunes out of context\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "Note from the author: Quantum foundations has to be one of my favourite topics in quantum theory. One of its main objectives is figuring out what makes quantum phenomena actually different from what we see in real life. I think contextuality might be one of the purest quantum phenomena, and I believe it is behind quantum speedups. Not everyone agrees on this though. This is a super interesting topic and I hope you'll find some motivation to look into it more!\n",

    "In the Dipole Desert, meteorological phenomena such as sandstorms are governed by strange physical laws. Meteorologists in Qutopia are experts in quantum theory and have used it to predict the sandstorms' frequency, intensities, and even the dune formations that they leave behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main hints that quantum theory was the best way to model the behaviour of the sandstorms is the formation known as the Contextual Dunes. These are a set of five dunes that exist in a superposition of crescentic ∣0⟩, linear ∣1⟩, and parabolic ∣2⟩ dune shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just because the dunes exist in a superposition, it doesn't mean that their behaviour is quantum. After all, there are classical theories that can model superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "You stand in awe in front of these dunes. For the first time, you witness superposition in real life! But you're witnessing so much more than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextuality is one of the features of quantum theory that sets it apart from classical models. Kochen-Specker contextuality means that the predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be reproduced by a hidden variables theory that\n",
    "1. is deterministic, and\n",
    "2. is measurement non-contextual. That is, when we measure a specific variable the result don't depend an how we make that measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, the concept of contextuality has been used to identify machine learning problems that might be more efficiently solvable using quantum computers. More generally, it is conjectured that contextuality is at the root of exponential quantum speedups.\n"

    "A simple proof of contextuality in quantum theory is due to Klyachko. It involves placing 5 qutrits $\\Ket{\\psi_0}, ..., Ket{\\psi_4}$ on a star shape, such that the qutrits that are joined by a line must be orthogonal to each other. See the figure below for reference.\n",
