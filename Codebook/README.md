Textbook is included in the written notes.

T.1 - Tutorial 
Introduction
* I.1
  * Write down a mathematical description of a qubit state in two different notations.
  * Define and give examples of what it means for a quantum system to be in a superposition of states.
  * State the relationship between amplitudes and measurement outcome probabilities, and what it means for a state to be normalized.
  * Explain how operations are mathematically applied to qubit states.
* I.2
  * Identify the different components of a quantum circuit (qubits, gates, and measurements).
  * Translate between sequences of instructions and a quantum circuit.
  * Define and calculate the depth of a quantum circuit.
* I.3
  * Define what it means for a matrix to be unitary.
  * Express a single-qubit unitary operation in terms of 3 real parameters.
* I.4
  * Explain why we can understand how an operation works by applying it to the basis states.
  * Describe the action of the X gate, its matrix representation, and eigenvalues.
  * Describe the action of the Hadamard gate, its matrix representation, and eigenvalues.
* I.5
  * Global and relative phase 
  * Describe the action of the RZ gate and its matrix representation.
  * Identify 3 special cases of RZ.
* I.6 
  * Describe the action of the RX gate and its matrix representation.
  * Describe the action of the RY gate and its matrix representation.
  * Represent qubit states in 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere.
* I.7
